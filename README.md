# AgroGuide
AgroGuide is a web-based platform designed to empower farmers and agriculture enthusiasts by leveraging machine learning to improve crop selection and plant health management.

Features
Crop Recommendation System:-
Suggests the most suitable crops for cultivation based on environmental and soil conditions.
Utilizes soil nutrients, humidity, and temperature as input parameters to predict the ideal crop for a given region.

Plant Disease Prediction System:-
Identifies plant diseases from uploaded images.
Employs advanced image classification techniques to detect and diagnose diseases accurately.

Technology Stack:-
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React if applicable).
Backend: Python Flask.
Machine Learning Models:
Crop recommendation using regression/classification techniques.
Disease prediction using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Usage:-
Input environmental data (soil nutrients, humidity, temperature) to receive crop recommendations.
Upload plant images to diagnose potential diseases.

Key Benefits:-
Enhances decision-making for farmers, reducing risks and increasing yields.
Promotes sustainable farming practices by aligning crops with environmental conditions.
Enables timely disease management to minimize losses.

Future Enhancements:-
Adding support for additional soil and weather parameters.
Expanding the disease prediction database to cover a wider variety of crops and diseases.
Integrating real-time weather data for dynamic recommendations.

NOTE:-
The datasets used for the Crop Recommendation System and Plant Disease Prediction System are not included in this repository due to their large file sizes. However, their sources and download links are provided in the requirements.txt file.
Please download the datasets from the specified links and place them in the appropriate directory before running the project.
